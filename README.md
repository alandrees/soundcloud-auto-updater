soundcloud-auto-updater
=======================

Automatically encodes a PCM wave file (a lit of which is retrived from a specified directory) into a compressed format, properly tagging the file with the correct metadata (encoded into the filename), uploading it to the configured Soundcloud account, and optionally emailing about success/failure.

I will be writing an information tagging and copying tool for Windows (using C# and .NET), and Linux (using Python and Qt).  Since I don't have access to OSX, I cannot create a Mac/Cocoa version.
